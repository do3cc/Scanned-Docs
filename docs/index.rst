   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Lembrar's documentation!
===================================

:mod:`Lembrar` is an application to help you to remember things.
As such you dump documentation, pdf, pictures and whatever you might need to remember again.

:mod:`Lembrar` is portuguese and means ``to remember``.

You can tag your contents, add descriptions and titles. Indexers can handle many data formats to extract written text from it, even from images.

While Lembrar provides a web interface, it is also meant to be embedded in other applications, so you can easily use its functions in your own application.

Lembrar is also extensible. You can install additional plugins. Out of the box it comes with plugins that use tika for text extraction from office documents and cuneiform, which can do OCR.
